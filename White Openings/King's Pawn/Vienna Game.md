The Vienna game is an opening originally designed to play a delayed King's Gambit, resulting in the Vienna Gambit. In modern chess, white tends to play more quietly.

The Vienna game follows the [[Open Game]], and offers white plenty of aggressive opportunities. However, it frees black to play more defensively and positionally, and many aggressive opportunities afford black free development.

## Max Lange Defense

The most common opening on Lichess is the Max Lange Defense, played 39% of the time. The following is the position:

```chesser
id: Lj-x75Ub
viewOnly: true
```

This position contains the knights evenly guarding center space. As such, removal of center control becomes the major focus. While white's most common move across all levels is 3. Nf3, most masters play and recommend 3. Bc4 in order to continue quick development.

### Mainline

The main line is the Two Knights variation.

```chesser
id: Zy2T_tjA
viewOnly: true
```

White is able to play a more solid gambit at this point. The move order is 4. d3, then 5. f4. If black decides to take the pawn, white gets to take back and develop simply.

```chesser
id: 2njviBOn
viewOnly: true
```

Now white has center control, and after reasonable development may develop the queen and castle long. The F file is permanently weak for black.

An interesting move order with this trap variation occurs often:

```chesser
id: RHchTvus
viewOnly: true
```

If black threatens to fork our rook and queen, we get an interesting trap. Black's best move here is to sacrifice their queen in order to stop the mate threat posed by our knight and queen. From that position, they can simply keep sacrificing pieces to stop infinite mate threats.

### Early D6

Instead of entering the Two Knights variation, black may decide to push d6 early. In this case, we simply castle kingside and push for an endgame. White has improved pawn structure, so this is generically winning.

### Copycat Trap

3...Bc5 is the second most popular position reached in the Max Lange Defense. It allows for an interesting early queen position:

```chesser
id: -8ynetUx
viewOnly: true
```

White is allowed to threaten taking the pawn and feasting on a trapped rook. If black pre-moves Nf6, we can simply take anyways. If black pushes to g6, we can simply play defensively, winning with greater development. Notably, the gambit move NO LONGER works and instantly loses.

```chesser

```

The most common response is Qf6, protecting the queen trap whilst simultaneously threatening check. This attack is empty, but we can exacerbate the process by baiting black to commit.

```chesser
id: 50WQVMZO
```

Black's queen is almost trapped, and there is only one possible square at which it is safe. Our knight also threatens a nasty king fork at the same time.

```chesser
id: 50WQVMZO
```

Playing 8. d3 cements the queen in her tomb, effectively killing black's chances of counterattack. The move c3 can win the queen at any point; Our knight still is poised and ready to win a rook as well. If they try to counterattack the queen, we can simply step back and threaten the f7 square.

### D5??

Notably, if black decides to play a stupid gambit, anchor your knight (1) or bishop (2) in the center. They cannot be kicked out easily, due to black's earlier move of Nc6.

## Falkbeer Defense

The Falkbeer Defense is played most commonly at the master level. The interesting portion of the line is the Vienna Gambit:

```chesser
id: 4kf9Rm0Z
viewOnly: true
```

This gambit is a delayed King's Gambit, but unlike the basic King's Gambit (or most other gambits), it is not objectively bad.

### Vienna Gambit Accepted

If black decides to take the pawn they're met with a swift 4. e5, kicking out the knight. The knight must retreat here.

```chesser

viewOnly: true
```

#### Ng8 - The Main Line

After the knight retreats, it's important for white to guard against 5...Qh4+, which loses castling rights.

```chesser
id: gtKhY0Ty
```

This move also guards the front pawn. From here, white should try to delay taking the free pawn as far as possible - Ideally, pinning the front pawn to the king. The discovery threat is extreme.

```chesser
id: 6P13fbH4
viewOnly: true
```

From here, black is in a fairly poor position. If black (instead of playing 5...d6) plays Nc6, we get to enact a more vicious variation:

```chesser
id: TZnxxAOC
viewOnly: true
```

Delaying the bishops' development is critical in this opening, but swiftly pinning the knight forces a worse position. The queen threat for pin is coming shortly. If black ever decides to play Bd7, their position gets significantly worse, as you can now kick the knight, trade the bishop, and fork the king by taking the front pawn with the knight.

#### Qe7 - The Worse Line

There is a line here where black can try to be 'sneaky' and guard with Qe7. We can simply threaten a discovery pin. Notably, our position is far better - If black doesn't retreat the knight, they risk tripling pawns on the F file. If they do retreat, we have plenty of long-term plans:

```chesser
id: Hsvl5QPe
viewOnly: false
```

Now we can play positionally with a better piece layout and development. Black has zero development and liabilities covering their position.

#### Be7 - The Worst Line

If black decides to defend with the bishop, the situation is instantly worse. Black completely foregoes all development, allowing white to get an extreme amount of center control immediately:

```chesser
id: sLMLPwDo
viewOnly: true
```

After this check, white may simply develop.

## Anderssen Defense

The Anderssen Defense is a relatively boring line, often arising from players that either pre-move or want to get out of theory quickly. White gains superior pawn structure and development, but the game is played more positionally.

## D6 Line

This line is extremely popular, but not very good for black. As such, it's a relatively simple move order:

```chesser
id: dKukBcNJ
viewOnly: true
```

White can gambit a center pawn here in order to disrupt black's center.

### Takes

If black takes, which is the most popular move, white gets to rip open the center with Qd4. Black's normal move develops and attacks the queen, who can simply move back. However, a more interesting line is 5. Bb5, pinning the knight.

```chesser
id: udBKZNHz
viewOnly: true
```

If black decides to unpin, trading the bishop off early leads to white having complete center control and black having little to no development. White may even force black to lose castling rights.

### Nc6

If black instead pulls their knight out, foregoing their center, white may push ahead, threatening the pawn and gaining more center control. It's white's opportunity to start pushing pawns forward, castling kingside in order to play a positionally-oriented game.

```chesser

```

Notably, white can create a pawn pyramid on the queen side and control the remainder of the game.
