## [Game 1](https://lichess.org/EOvxHcrv/white) - Rapid (10+5) - White

This game is a hallmark in the ideology that one should never surrender. Chiefly, my opponent *did* surrender. However, I did not notice a move that my opponent walked into (which, may I add, was an exceedingly stupid move!) Had my opponent played on, they (potentially) would have won the game immediately. Oops! My rating improved to 1268.

The opening was good and I was relatively dominant, but I threw away this lead. The middlegame favored black heavily until a chief slip-up.

My opponent fell into the [[Vienna Game#Trash Variation|Trash Variation of the Vienna Gambit]] (seriously, that's what it's called!)
